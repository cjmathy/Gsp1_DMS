Explanation of datafiles




### DDG DATA
files:
  - 20200806_gsp1_ddg.csv
  - 20200806_gsp1_ddg_with_scores.csv

Files generated by script '~/lab/gsp1_ddg/cartddg/protocol_runs/20200806/compile_ddg/py
The second file contains score terms (averaged over five replicates) for each mutant (MUT and WT sim's)

### FITNESS DATA
file: 15gen_binned_0607.csv


## CONSURF stuff
scores are centered around 0 and they are Z-score like with negative being more conserved
binned from categories 1 to 9 where 9 is most conserved

so 0 is an average conservation of a position in the phylogenetic tree constructed by consurf

consurf gives you all the aa's that appear in that position, but we don't know what it means. 


## BURIAL

First distinction: effector lobe, allosteric lobe, tail

Second distinction:

Structural core: always buried
Interface core: in at least one interface core
Surface: always exposed
mixed: sometimes interface sometimes surface
