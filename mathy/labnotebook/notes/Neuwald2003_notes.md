# Neuwald 2003 notes

Neuwald, A. F., Kannan, N., Poleksic, A., Hata, N., & Liu, J. S. (2003). Ran’s C-terminal, basic patch, and nucleotide exchange mechanisms in light of a canonical structure for Rab, Rho, Ras, and Ran GTPases. Genome Research, 13(4), 673–692.

- Several key interactions they see as arising in the prototypical FY-pivot GTPase (Sec4) show either no or partial sensitivity to mutation in our assay, reflecting the fact that several of these interactions can be lost in some members of the family
