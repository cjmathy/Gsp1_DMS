# 2021-01-17 GAP Assay

Running GAP assay with WT (202010110 prep), G35D (PE43, 20201206 prep), G35A (PE44, 20201206 prep)

- Spun down 1 tube of samples at max speed, 4C, 20min
- measured concentrations with 1:50 dilution

  Sample | 1:50 ng/mL | concentration | A260/A280 |
  ---- | --- | --- | --- | 
  WT   | 0.812 | 1.6 mM | 0.75 |
  G35D | 1.141 | 2.3 mM | 0.76 |
  G35A | 0.333 | 670 uM | 0.77 |

## GTP Loading

- Loaded each sample to 20-fold excess GTP, 10 mM EDTA, 1-2 mM DTT
    - loaded 2 tubes per sample, to serve as replicates
    - full set of reagent volumes in the excel sheet at `20210117_loading.xlsx`
- Started incubation at 15h20, quenched much later than intended, at 14h00
- During incubation, prepared 100 mL assay buffer: 40 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT
- After loading, quenched, then buffer exchanged on 6 Nap-5 columns (2 loadings x 3 mutants), fractionated with 65 uL
- Set A quenched at 21h20. Set B quenched at 22h20. Took fractions 4 and 5 for all samples
    Sample | Fraction | mg/mL | concentration | A260/A280 |
    ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
    WT (A)   | 3-5 | 1.659 mg/mL | 66.9 uM | 0.78
    G35D (A) | 4-7 | 2.579 mg/mL | 104 uM | 0.77
    G35A (A) | 5-7 | 1.182 mg/mL | 47.7 uM | 0.78
    WT (B)   | 5-6 | 1.533 mg/mL | 61.8 uM | 0.78
    G35D (B) | 4-6 | 3.650 mg/mL | 147 uM | 0.77
    G35A (B) | 6-8 | 1.723 mg/mL | 69.5 uM | 0.77

## Setting up the plate
- Edited Tina's script to set up the plate: 20210117_GAP_Assay.R
- Samples:
    - Odd wells have 10 uL of 10 nM GAP (10x, final concentration 1 nM), even wells have 10 uL buffer
    - 5 nM of each sample
    - first 6 wells with one phosphate sensor dilution, second 6 wells with a different one

- Sensor prep:
    - spun down 20 min at max speed, 4C.
    - Lot 2198260E
    - aliquoted into 7 tubes of 33 uL. Immediately flash froze in LN2 five of the tubes, leaving two for the experiment
    - Calculated the aliquots as follows: we want 20 uM sensor in 100 uL reaction. The premix is 110 uL, so 22.2 uM sensor. We dilute into the premix from a 125 uM stock, so the amount diluted for each premix is 22.2 * 110 / 125 = 19.536. We want enough for 6, and prepare 5% extra, meaning we need 123.0768 uL of the 125 uM stock. This is a 4x dilution from the 500 uM sensor we purchase, so we need at least 30.7692. I was able to split the tube we received into 7x33 uL aliquots, which need to be diluted with 99 uL assay buffer to get the 125 uM stock.
    - Each loading should be run with a different diluted sensor, as Tina suspects the dilution of the sensor is one of the biggest sources of batch effects. 

- GAP prep:
    - Spun down the GAP, used 20190116 20 uL aliquot, 103.12 uM. Right before setting up the plate, followed dilution notes from Tina:

```{note}
- Prepare the SpGAP enzyme (I spin it down with the Gsp1 samples and dilute it in assay buffer shortly before setting up assay using this particular dilution order)
- SpRNA1 from 20190116 (no His tag) -> 103.12 uM ----> 20 x dilution to make ~5 uM GAP ---->  10 ul of GAP + 190 ul of buffer
- Dilute 25x to ~ 0.2 uM (200 nM) --->   32 ul of ~5 uM GAP + 768 ul of buffer (This can be measured by Bradford, but skip it, just dilute like in the next step)
- Dilute 20x to final concentration of 10 nM:  10 ul of ~200 nM SpGAP + 190 ul buffer
```

- Used Corning 3881 plates: Black, low-binding, half-area, clear and flat bottom
- Premixed sensor, Gsp1, and buffer (total volume 110 uL) placed in wells D1-D12 on plate, placed 10 uL GAP (or buffer, every other) in wells C1-C12.
- Once plate reader was at 30C, put plate on plate holder to pre-warm for 10 min, set up experiment file
- transferred 90 uL of Gsp1/sensor premix to wells C1-C12, mixed, then started the reaction
- NOTE: I messed up with my tubes, and added WT B when I meant to add G35D.
    - so the order is WT A, WT B, G35A (PE44) A, G35D (PE43) A, G35D (PE43) B, G35A (PE44) B
    - The only sample that that really matters for is wells C3-C4, WT B +/- GAP, which has 4 uL more of buffer than it should. so the Gsp1 concentration is off by 3.6%
    - Should probably just exclude this WT, since I can easily have extra WT samples in the final dataset.
    - This does mean that both G35D samples were measured with the same sensor dilution, but the variability can be assessed from the two G35A samples, and there doesn't seem to be much on first glance (I need to quantify it though)

## HPLC
- Ran S75 Analytical on the HPLC with the samples, injecting 100 uL of the "A" sample. Also used 100 uL of standard (probably should have used less, I think 60 uL is max for this size column)
