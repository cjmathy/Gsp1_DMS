# 2021-01-18 GAP Assay

Running GAP assay with F54A (PE45, 20201206 prep), F54K (PE46, 20210110 prep), F54W (PE47, 20201206 prep)

- NOTE: F54W HAS A DIFFERENT EXTINCTION COEFFICIENT: 43175 INSTEAD OF 37675
- Spun down 1 tube of samples at max speed, 4C, 20min
- measured concentrations with 1:50 dilution

Sample | 1:25 mg/mL | concentration | A260/A280 |
---- | --- | --- | --- | 
F54A | 0.267 | 270 uM | 0.79 |
F54K | 0.627 | 632 uM | 1.45 |
F54W | 0.249 | 251 uM | 0.80 |

## GTP Loading

- Loaded each sample to 20-fold excess GTP, 10 mM EDTA, 1-2 mM DTT
    - loaded 2 tubes per sample, to serve as replicates
    - full set of reagent volumes in the excel sheet at `20210118_loading.xlsx`
- Started incubation at 12h00
- During incubation, prepared 100 mL assay buffer:
    
    Reagent      | Final Conc | Stock Conc | Volume  | 
    ------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ------- | 
    HEPES pH 7.5 | 40 mM      | 500 mM     | 8 mL    | 
    NaCl         | 100 mM     | 4 M        | 2.5 mL  |
    MgCl2        | 4 mM       | 1 M        | 400 uL  | 
    DTT          | 1 mM       | 1 M        | 100 uL  |
    ddH2O        | ---        | ---        | 89 mL   |


- After loading, buffer exchanged on 6 Nap-5 columns (2 loadings x 3 mutants), fractionated with 65 uL
- Set A quenched at 15h10. Set B quenched at 15h50. Took fractions 4 and 5 for all samples
    - F54A (A): 1.086 mg/mL = 43.8 uM, 0.82 A260/A280
    - F54K (A): 0.610 mg/mL = 24.6 uM, 1.46 A260/A280
    - F54W (A): 0.975 mg/mL = 39.3 uM, 0.76 A260/A280
    - F54A (B): 1.075 mg/mL = 43.3 uM, 0.84 A260/A280
    - F54K (B): 0.520 mg/mL = 21.0 uM, 1.45 A260/A280
    - F54W (B): 0.739 mg/mL = 29.8 uM, 0.77 A260/A280
- F54K still has the high A260/A280 that it had after purification (I had hoped that the NAP-5 exchange would help). There seems to be a contaminant of some sort. Perhaps the analytical will show a second species.

- Edited Tina's script to set up the plate: `20210118_GAP_Assay.R`. That produces `reaction_mix_temp.txt` in this directory
- Samples:
    - Odd wells have 10 uL of 10 nM GAP (10x, final concentration 1 nM), even wells have 10 uL buffer
    - 5 nM of each sample
    - first 6 wells with one phosphate sensor dilution, second 6 wells with a different one
- Sensor prep:
    - spun down 2 of the 33 uL aliquots prepared on 20210117 (Lot 2198260E), 20 min at max speed, 4C.
    - Diluted 4x with 99 uL assay buffer to 125 uM
- GAP prep:
    - Spun down the GAP, used 20190116 20 uL aliquot, 103.12 uM. Right before setting up the plate, followed dilution notes from Tina:

```{note}
- Prepare the SpGAP enzyme (I spin it down with the Gsp1 samples and dilute it in assay buffer shortly before setting up assay using this particular dilution order)
- SpRNA1 from 20190116 (no His tag) -> 103.12 uM ----> 20 x dilution to make ~5 uM GAP ---->  10 ul of GAP + 190 ul of buffer
- Dilute 25x to ~ 0.2 uM (200 nM) --->   32 ul of ~5 uM GAP + 768 ul of buffer (This can be measured by Bradford, but skip it, just dilute like in the next step)
- Dilute 20x to final concentration of 10 nM:  10 ul of ~200 nM SpGAP + 190 ul buffer
```

- Used Corning 3881 plates: Black, low-binding, half-area, clear and flat bottom
- Premixed sensor, Gsp1, and buffer (total volume 110 uL) placed in wells F1-F12 on plate, placed 10 uL GAP (or buffer, every other) in wells E1-E12.
- Once plate reader was at 30C, put plate on plate holder to pre-warm for 10 min, set up experiment file
- transferred 90 uL of Gsp1/sensor premix to wells E1-E12, mixed, then started the reaction

- Ran S75 Analytical on the HPLC by combining the A and B samples for each mutant, to have enough volume to inject 100 uL
