# 2021-01-20 GAP Assay

Running GAP assay with F159L (PE48, 20210110 prep), F159W (PE59 20210110 prep), F163L (PE60 20201215 prep)

- NOTE: F159W HAS A DIFFERENT EXTINCTION COEFFICIENT: 43175 INSTEAD OF 37675
- Spun down 1 tube of each sample at max speed, 4C, 20min
- F163L (PE50) had aggregation at the bottom of the tube (I always transfer the supernatant to a new, chilled tube after spinning Gsp1 mutants)
- measured concentrations with 1:50 dilution

  Sample | 1:50 mg/mL | concentration | A260/A280 |
  ---- | --- | --- | --- | 
  F159L | 2.627 | 5.3 mM | 0.75 |
  F159W | 0.575 | 1.16 mM | 0.76 |
  F163L | 0.620 | 1.25 mM | 0.79 |

## GTP Loading

- Loaded each sample to 20-fold excess GTP, 10 mM EDTA, 2-4 mM DTT
    - loaded 2 tubes per sample, to serve as replicates
    - full set of reagent volumes in the excel sheet at `20210119_loading.xlsx`
- Started incubation at 11h30
- During incubation, prepared 100 mL assay buffer: 40 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT
- After loading, quenched, then buffer exchanged on 6 Nap-5 columns (2 loadings x 3 mutants). Usually stack the volume of the sample (say, 50 uL) up to 500 uL with buffer (so, 450 uL in the example). But the first two fractions have been uniformly without protein, so this time stacked up to 600 uL, then collected 6x65 uL fraction
- Set A quenched at 14h30. Set B quenched at 15h10.

  Sample | Fractions | 1:10 mg/mL | concentration | A260/A280 |
  ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
  F159L (A) | 1-5 | 0.407 mg/mL | 164 uM | 0.78
  F159W (A) | 2-5 | 0.111 mg/mL | 44.8 uM | 0.74
  F163L (A) | 2-5 | 0.579 mg/mL | 233 uM | 0.83
  F159L (B) | 2-5 | 0.520 mg/mL | 210 uM | 0.79
  F159W (B) | 2-4 | 0.105 mg/mL | 42.3 uM | 0.76
  F163L (B) | 2-4 | 0.662 mg/mL | 267 uM | 0.83

- Edited Tina's script to set up the plate: `20210118_GAP_Assay.R`. That produces `reaction_mix_temp.txt` in this directory
- Samples:
    - Odd wells have 10 uL of 10 nM GAP (10x, final concentration 1 nM), even wells have 10 uL buffer
    - 5 nM of each sample
    - first 6 wells with one phosphate sensor dilution, second 6 wells with a different one
- Sensor prep:
    - spun down 2 of the 33 uL aliquots prepared on 20210117 (Lot 2198260E), 20 min at max speed, 4C.
    - Diluted 4x with 99 uL assay buffer to 125 uM
- GAP prep:
    - Spun down the GAP, used 20190116 20 uL aliquot, 103.12 uM. Right before setting up the plate, followed dilution notes from Tina:

```{note}
- Prepare the SpGAP enzyme (I spin it down with the Gsp1 samples and dilute it in assay buffer shortly before setting up assay using this particular dilution order)
- SpRNA1 from 20190116 (no His tag) -> 103.12 uM ----> 20 x dilution to make ~5 uM GAP ---->  10 ul of GAP + 190 ul of buffer
- Dilute 25x to ~ 0.2 uM (200 nM) --->   32 ul of ~5 uM GAP + 768 ul of buffer (This can be measured by Bradford, but skip it, just dilute like in the next step)
- Dilute 20x to final concentration of 10 nM:  10 ul of ~200 nM SpGAP + 190 ul buffer
```

- Used Corning 3881 plates: Black, low-binding, half-area, clear and flat bottom
- Premixed sensor, Gsp1, and buffer (total volume 110 uL) placed in wells F1-F12 on plate, placed 10 uL GAP (or buffer, every other) in wells E1-E12.
- Once plate reader was at 30C, put plate on plate holder to pre-warm for 10 min, set up experiment file
- transferred 90 uL of Gsp1/sensor premix to wells E1-E12, mixed, then started the reaction


## HPLC

- Prepared Set A samples to 40 uM for S75 Analytical, began running. After injecting F159L and F159W, I realized I had left the waste valve open (so the sample was not injected onto the column). At 23h20 grabbed F159L (A) and F159W (B) from the trash bin (at room temp...) and prepared new samples. Concentration of F159L was again at 40 uM, F159W probably ~20 uM. Began run at 23h30 with column equilibration, etc. Samples are at 4C in the HPLC sample holder, but significant hydrolysis or nucleotide drop-off could have occurred.

## CD
- Ran CD samples from 19h00-22h00
- Diluted samples to ~2-3 uM for CD
- Buffer is 1:20 dilution of assay buffer: 2 mM HEPES, 5 mM NaCl, 200 uM MgCl2, 50 uM DTT

  Sample | mg/mL | concentration | A260/A280 |
  --- | --- | --- | --- | 
  F159L (B) | 0.052 mg/mL | 2.096 uM | 0.79
  F159W (B) | 0.067 mg/mL | 2.702 uM | 0.56
  F163L (B) | 0.043 mg/mL | 1.734 uM | 0.81
  
- The low A260/A280 suggests that the nucleotide may have fallen off of F159W
