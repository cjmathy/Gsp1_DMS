# 2020-11-17 GAP Assay

Running pilot GAP assay with F28V (20201110 prep), F28Y (20201110 prep), and WT (20181206 prep)

- Spun down samples at max speed, 4C
- measured concentrations (used 1:50 dilution for WT)

Sample | ng/mL | concentration | A260/A280 |
---- | --- | --- | --- | 
WT   | 31 | 1.25 mM | 0.76 |
F28V | 2.588 | 104.3 uM | 0.92 |
F28Y | 7.366 | 297 uM | 0.75 |

## GTP Loading

- Loaded each sample to 20-fold excess GTP, 10 mM EDTA, 1-2 mM DTT
    - full set of reagent volumes in the excel sheet at 20201117_loading.xlsx
- Started incubation at 11h00, quenched at 14h00
- Buffer exchanged on Nap-5 columns, fractionated with 65 uL
    - WT: Fractions 3-7, final concentration 3.108 mg/mL 0.78 A260/A280
    - F28V: Fractions 5-7, final concentration 1.054 mg/mL 0.94 A260/A280
    - F28Y: Fractions 2-4, final concentration 1.557 mg/mL 0.77 A260/A280

- During incubation, prepared 50 mL assay buffer:
    
    Reagent      | Final Conc | Stock Conc | Volume  | 
    ------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ------- | 
    HEPES pH 7.5 | 40 mM      | 500 mM     | 4 mL    | 
    NaCl         | 100 mM     | 4 M        | 1.25 mL |
    MgCl2        | 4 mM       | 1 M        | 200 uL  | 
    DTT          | 1 mM       | 1 M        | 50 uL   |
    ddH2O        | ---        | ---        | 44.5 mL |

- Spun down the GAP, used 20190116 20 uL aliquot, 103.12 uM. Right before setting up the plate, followed dilution notes from Tina:

```{note}
- Prepare the SpGAP enzyme (I spin it down with the Gsp1 samples and dilute it in assay buffer shortly before setting up assay using this particular dilution order)
- SpRNA1 from 20190116 (no His tag) -> 103.12 uM ----> 20 x dilution to make ~5 uM GAP ---->  10 ul of GAP + 190 ul of buffer
- Dilute 25x to ~ 0.2 uM (200 nM) --->   32 ul of ~5 uM GAP + 768 ul of buffer (This can be measured by Bradford, but skip it, just dilute like in the next step)
- Dilute 20x to final concentration of 10 nM:  10 ul of ~200 nM SpGAP + 190 ul buffer
```

- Edited Tina's script to set up the plate: 20201117_GAP_Assay.R
- Samples:
    - Odd wells have 10 uL of 10 nM GAP (10x, final concentration 1 nM), even wells have 10 uL buffer
    - 5 nM of sample: WT (A1/A2), F28V (A3/A4), F28Y (A7/A8)
    - 10 nM of sample: F28V (A5/A6), F28Y (A9/A10)
- Spun down [Phosphate Sensor](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/PV4406#/PV4406), LOT 1853001A, CAT PV4406 diluted to 125 uM
- Used Corning 3881 plates: Black, low-binding, half-area, clear and flat bottom
- Premixed sensor, Gsp1, and buffer (total volume 110 uL) placed in wells B1-B10 on plate, placed 10 uL GAP (or buffer) in wells A1-A10.
- Once plate reader was at 30C, put plate on plate holder, transferred 90 uL of Gsp1/sensor premix to wells A1-A10, mixed (and unfortunately added some bubbles), and started the reaction
- Forgot to pre-warm the samples before mixing by incubating in the plate reader at 30C for ten minutes, but Tina said it doesn't look like that was an issue, from the beginning of the curves.
