# 2021-01-19 GAP Assay

Running GAP assay with F159L (PE48, 20210110 prep), F159W (PE59 20210110 prep), F163L (PE60 20201215 prep)

- NOTE: F159W HAS A DIFFERENT EXTINCTION COEFFICIENT: 43175 INSTEAD OF 37675
- Spun down 1 tube of each sample at max speed, 4C, 20min
- F163L (PE50) had aggregation at the bottom of the tube (I always transfer the supernatant to a new, chilled tube after spinning Gsp1 mutants)
- measured concentrations with 1:50 dilution

  Sample | 1:50 mg/mL | concentration | A260/A280 |
  ---- | --- | --- | --- | 
  F159L | 2.627 | 5.3 mM | 0.75 |
  F159W | 0.575 | 1.16 mM | 0.76 |
  F163L | 0.620 | 1.25 mM | 0.79 |

## GTP Loading

- Loaded each sample to 20-fold excess GTP, 10 mM EDTA, 2-4 mM DTT
    - loaded 2 tubes per sample, to serve as replicates
    - full set of reagent volumes in the excel sheet at `20210119_loading.xlsx`
- Started incubation at 11h30
- During incubation, prepared 100 mL assay buffer: 40 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT
- After loading, quenched, then buffer exchanged on 6 Nap-5 columns (2 loadings x 3 mutants), fractionated with 65 uL
- Set A quenched at XXhXX. Set B quenched at XXhXX. Took fractions 4 and 5 for all samples

- Edited Tina's script to set up the plate: `20210118_GAP_Assay.R`. That produces `reaction_mix_temp.txt` in this directory
- Samples:
    - Odd wells have 10 uL of 10 nM GAP (10x, final concentration 1 nM), even wells have 10 uL buffer
    - 5 nM of each sample
    - first 6 wells with one phosphate sensor dilution, second 6 wells with a different one
- Sensor prep:
    - spun down 2 of the 33 uL aliquots prepared on 20210117 (Lot 2198260E), 20 min at max speed, 4C.
    - Diluted 4x with 99 uL assay buffer to 125 uM
- GAP prep:
    - Spun down the GAP, used 20190116 20 uL aliquot, 103.12 uM. Right before setting up the plate, followed dilution notes from Tina:

```{note}
- Prepare the SpGAP enzyme (I spin it down with the Gsp1 samples and dilute it in assay buffer shortly before setting up assay using this particular dilution order)
- SpRNA1 from 20190116 (no His tag) -> 103.12 uM ----> 20 x dilution to make ~5 uM GAP ---->  10 ul of GAP + 190 ul of buffer
- Dilute 25x to ~ 0.2 uM (200 nM) --->   32 ul of ~5 uM GAP + 768 ul of buffer (This can be measured by Bradford, but skip it, just dilute like in the next step)
- Dilute 20x to final concentration of 10 nM:  10 ul of ~200 nM SpGAP + 190 ul buffer
```

- Used Corning 3881 plates: Black, low-binding, half-area, clear and flat bottom
- Premixed sensor, Gsp1, and buffer (total volume 110 uL) placed in wells F1-F12 on plate, placed 10 uL GAP (or buffer, every other) in wells E1-E12.
- Once plate reader was at 30C, put plate on plate holder to pre-warm for 10 min, set up experiment file
- transferred 90 uL of Gsp1/sensor premix to wells E1-E12, mixed, then started the reaction

- Ran S75 Analytical on the HPLC by combining the A and B samples for each mutant, to have enough volume to inject 100 uL
