# 2020-10-29 Gsp1 Mutant Expression

Goal: express pET28a+ mutants in BL21 cells. Tina previously prepped the plasmids and the competent BL21 cells

## 2020-10-29 Transformation

- Transforming BL21 cells with the following plasmids
    - pE53_H32D
    - pE54_H32E
    - pE57_F163Y
    - pE58_H50N
    - pE59_H50R
    - pE60_P51A

- Heat shocked, recovered 50 min at 37C, spun down 2m at 4000 rpm, plated on LB+Kan, overnight at 37C

## 2020-10-30 Inoculation
- All transformations worked, Tina inoculated in auto-induction media at ~14h00
