# 2021-01-28 CD

Running CD with WT (202010110 prep), G35D (PE43, 20201206 prep), G35A (PE44, 20201206 prep)

- Spun down 1 tube of samples at max speed, 4C, 20min
- measured concentrations with 1:50 dilution

  Sample | 1:50 ng/mL | concentration | A260/A280 |
  ---- | --- | --- | --- | 
  WT   | 0.983 | 2.0 mM | 0.76 |
  G35D | 1.283 | 2.6 uM | 0.76 |
  G35A | 0.390 | 786 uM | 0.77 |

## GTP Loading
- Decided to do just one hour loading, as this should be sufficient for these mutants and we're not measuring a quantitative property (like in the GAP assay), but more so trying to get an estimate Tm
- Staggered incubations to avoid long hydrolysis
- Loaded each sample to 20-fold excess GTP, 10 mM EDTA, 1-2 mM DTT, incubated 1 hour, quenched with MgCl2
- full set of reagent volumes in the excel sheet at `20210128_loading.xlsx`
    - note that I added buffer to the WT sample to increase the volume, so that the quench volume isn't too low
    - aliquoted the needed amount of protein to other tubes and re-froze (noting the extra freeze-thaw cycle) to save protein
- Equilibrated NAP-5 columns in GAP assay buffer: 40 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT
- Applied sample to Nap-5 column, added buffer up to 600 uL after it, then fractionated with 4 x 80 uL
- Measured fractions and picked one to make dilution for CD. For G35A, diluted fraction 2 and re-measured so the mg/ml was under 1.0 (more reliable on the nanodrop), since fractions 2 and 3 were both aroun 2.0 mg/ml.

    Sample | Incubation start time | Quench time | Fraction used | Fraction mg/ml | A260/A280 | DIlution | Estimated final conc.
    ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
    WT   | 11h30 | 12h30 | 3 | 0.897 | 0.75 | 1:20 | 1.81 uM |
    G35D | 12h33 | 13h33 | 1 | 1.231 | 0.77 | 1:30 | 1.65 uM |
    G35A | 13h41 | 14h41 | 2 | 0.896 | 0.77 | 1:20 | 1.81 uM  |

## CD
- Diluted samples to ~1-2 uM for CD
- Buffer is 1:20 dilution of assay buffer: 2 mM HEPES, 5 mM NaCl, 200 uM MgCl2, 50 uM DTT
- WT is with 0.2 cm path length cuvette, G35D and G35A with 0.1 cm path lengths.
- The G35D sample did not seem to melt, so I wanted to try it again. So I rinsed the cuvette that had the G35D sample with ddH2O and re-diluted another fraction (below) to run again, and measured the melting at 220 instead of 210, and more slowly
  - G35D fraction 2 was 4.444 mg/ml, 0.77 A260/A280
  - diluted 1:20 and it was 0.210 mg/ml, 0.75 A260/A280 => 8.47 uM
  - diluted 1:6 from that to get 1.41 uM for CD
