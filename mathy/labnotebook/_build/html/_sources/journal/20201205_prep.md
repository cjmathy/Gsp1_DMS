# 20201205 through 20200110 - Gsp1 Mutant Expression

## 2020-12-05 lysis and Ni-NTA binding
- purifying the following mutants:
    - PE43_G35D (DN), 150 mL pellet from 3L of culture (11/06, 11/20 growths)
    - PE44_G35A (TOL), 50 mL pellet from 1L of culture (10/30 growth)
    - PE45_F54A (DN), 150 mL pellet from 3L of culture (10/30, 11/20 growths)
    - PE47_F54W (TOL), 50 mL pellet from 1L of culture (10/30 growth)
    - PE51_H32I (DN), 150 mL pellet from 3L of culture (10/30 11/20 growths)
    - PE52_H32L (TOL), 50 mL pellet from 1L of culture (11/06 growth)
- took out from -80C to thaw at RT at 10h30
- from 16h00-19h00:
    - transferred pellet(s) to a 250 mL flask per tube, added beta-mercaptoethanol, homogeneized with a stir bar
    - lysed each in the microfluidizer, washing thoroughly with cold, then hot ddH2O between samples to avoid carry over
    - spun down cell debris using the floor centrifugre, 25.50 rotor, 18000 rpm, 30 min
    - prepared 2 mL of NiNTA resin per 1L induction culture (so 2 mL for TOL, 6 mL for DN) by washing in ddH2O
    - washed 4x with 40 mL Wash buffer, 1x in 30 mL thrombin buffer, using 6 min spins at 1500 rpm
    - added 10 mL thrombin buffer to each sample + 100 ul thrombin (200 U/mL) per 1L induction culture
    - nutated samples overnight, until 14h15

## 2020-12-06 purification and concentration 
- Prepared 1L of protein buffer: 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2
- Washed 1 mL resin to trap nonspecific binders
- spun down overnight, transferred supernatant to the second resin
- added buffer with 1mM DTT to the first resin to collect any leftover protein from resin, and used buffer to balance the tubes for the second resin. Some of the pellets turned brown, because you're not supposed to add DTT (a strong reducer) to the NiNTA beads, as it reduces them, they lose their charge and they can no longer bind. I had forgotten that I always did this wash step with BME or no reducing agent, but never with DTT.
- Didn't collect the resin 1 extra volume, just spun down the resin 2 and transferred the supernatant through a syringe/filter (0.2 uM) and into amicon filter columns (10k). The color definitely improved, as the resin got stuck in the filter
- Concentrated 20 min at max speed. Unfortunately three of the samples still had color. decided to dilute to 50 mL (about 1:40) with no DTT, then passed each sample through three more filters. Concentrated down to 15 mL, then left overnight
- Realized I might need more reducing agent as the DTT degrades, so added BME to ~2mM.
- Concentrated down to ~250 uL (40 min spin). All but one sample maintained their clear color on the filter column, suggesting the syringe/filters had removed the resin. One sample had some brown tint but much less than before.
- Measured samples on the nanodrop, aliquoted, and froze.

Sample | Dilution | mg/mL | concentration | A260/A280 | aliquots |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
PE43_G35D | 1:50 | 1.354 | 0.76 | 2.729 mM | 4 x 100 uL |
PE44_G35A | 1:50 | 0.409 | 0.78 | 824 uM   | 3 x 75 uL  |
PE45_F54A | 1:20 | 0.344 | 0.77 | 277 uM   | 4 x 100 uL | 
PE47_F54W | 1:20 | 0.376 | 0.75 | 303 uM   | 3 x 290 uL |

PE52_H32L | 1:50 | 0.452 | 0.77 | 911 uM   | 3 x 290 uL |

- Ran gel using the dilutions for the nanodrop:
    - 1:50 dilutions were 100 uL, so added 35 uL 4x Laemmli sample buffer and 15 uL BME (10% final)
    - 1:20 dilutions were 40 uL, so added 15 uL Laemmli and 6 uL BME
    - for resins 1 and 2, just took 2 uL and added to 18 uL of 1x Laemmli + 10% BME
- boiled samples 5 min, then loaded 2 gels, 12 well, 4-20%
- Order (L - "protein plus" Ladder, R1 - resin 1, R2 - resin 2, S - sample, E - empty) 
    - gel1 (l-r): Ladder, 43R1, 43R2, 43S, E, 44R1, 44R2, 44S, E, 45R1, 45R2, 45S
    - gel2 (l-r): Ladder, 47R1, 47R2, 47S, E, 51R1, 51R2, 51S, L, 52R1, 52R2, 52S

    - PE50_F163L (DN), 150 mL pellet from 3L of culture (10/27 growth)
    - PE53_H32D (DN), 150 mL pellet from 3L of culture (10/30 growth)

- Tina lysed and bound to resin

## 2020-12-15 purification
- Tina removed nonspecific binders with a second resin, then filtered through a syringe and began concentrating
- I finished concentrating and froze aliqotus:

Sample | Dilution | mg/mL | concentration | A260/A280 | aliquots |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
PE50_F163L | 1:50 | 0.548 | 0.78 | 1.1 mM | 4 x 150 uL |
PE53_H32D  | 1:50 | 1.083 | 0.77 | 2.2 mM | 4 x 200 uL |
PE54_H32E  | 1:50 | 0.372 | 0.78 | 760 uM | 4 x 150 uL | 
PE57_F163Y | 1:50 | 0.400 | 0.77 | 806 uM | 4 x 125 uL |
PE58_H50N  | 1:50 | 0.918 | 0.76 | 1.8 mM | 4 x 130 uL |
PE59_H50R  | 1:50 | 0.608 | 0.75 | 1.2 mM | 4 x 160 uL |

- Tina prepared gel samples of resin, and asked me to run gel with 1 uL of sample (was probably too much given how concentrated they are):
- Order: Ladder, then each samples resin 1 followed by the sample, in numerical order (50, 53, 54, 57, 58, 59)


## 2021-01-10 Purification

- Thawed and re-froze (-80C) pellets 2x (on 01/08 and 01/09) because of poor planning
- Thawed on 01/10:
    - PE1_WT, 50 mL from 1L of culture (11/06 growth) 
    - PE46_F54K (DN), 150 mL pellet from 3L of culture (12/08 growth)
    - PE48_F159L (DN), 150 mL pellet from 3L of culture (12/19 growth)
    - PE49_F159W (TOL), 50 mL pellet from 1L of culture (12/19 growths)
    - PE63_F28V (DN), 150 mL pellet from 3L of culture (12/15 growth)
    - PE64_F28Y (TOL), 50 mL pellet from 1L of culture (12/15 growth)
- Lysed and bound to 2 mL of NiNTA resin slurry per L of culture
- Digested overnight with 100 mL of thrombin per L of culture in 10-15 mL thrombin cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM BME)
- On 01/11, bound non-specific binders with 1 mL of resin slurry, and collected additional supernatant from resin 1 (overnight) using 10 mL of protein buffer (50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 2 mM BME NOT DTT for this step, because of the resin)
- Ran through syringe filter and concentrated to 200-1000 uL on 10K amicon column. Then diluted once with 15 mL more of the protein buffer to further bring the MgCl2 concentration down towards 4 mM.
- Measured concentration with 1:50 dilutions, aliquoted

    Sample | Dilution | mg/mL | concentration | A260/A280 | aliquots |
    --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
    PE1_WT     | 1:50 | 0.996 | 0.72 | 2.0 mM | 9 x 30 uL |
    PE46_F54K  | 1:50 | 0.331 | 1.41 | 667 uM | 5 x 30 uL |
    PE48_F159L | 1:50 | 2.646 | 0.75 | 5.3 mM | 6 x 50 uL |

    PE64_F28Y  | 1:50 | 0.801 | 0.73 | 1.6 mM | 5 x 40 uL |

    - Note that PE49 (F156W) has a different extinction coefficient of 35410 + 7765 = 43175 (7765 is for the nucleotide)

- stored Resin 1 (R1), Resing 2 (R2), and 1:50 dilutions of sample (S) overnight at 4C to run gel on 01/12
    - used 15 ul of those samples + 5 uL 4x Laemmli + 10% BME, boiled 5 min, spun down. loaded 15 uL
    - order for each sample was R1, R2, S
    - first gel: ladder, WT, PE46 (F54K), PE48 (F159L)
    - second gel: PE49 (F159W), ladder, PE63 (F28V), PE64 (F28Y)
